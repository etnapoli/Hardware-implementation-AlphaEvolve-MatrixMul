% Scalar version of the AlphaEvolve algorithm for 4x4 complex-valued 
% matrix multiplication.
%
% This file contains the scalar version of the equations:
%   b_r = <v^(r), B>
% that compute the complex terms b0, ..., b47 after CSE algorithm.
%
% In the equations below, the real and imaginary parts of each 
% variable are indicated with '_r' and '_i', respectively 
% (e.g., b0_r, b0_i, b34_r).
% The equations of the Frobenius product have been separated
% leaving a total of 96 equations (48 for the real parts and 48 for the 
% imaginary parts).
%
% The input matrix B is a 4x4 matrix with complex values.
% It has been split into its real and imaginary parts, and each
% part has been vectorized. The terms are named Breal and Bimag.
%
% Hence, the terms below have the following meaning:
%   Breal(1)   = Re(B(1,1))
%   Bimag(1)   = Im(B(1,1))
%   Breal(2)   = Re(B(2,1))
%   Bimag(2)   = Im(B(2,1))
%   Breal(13)  = Re(B(1,3))
%   Bimag(14)  = Im(B(2,4))
