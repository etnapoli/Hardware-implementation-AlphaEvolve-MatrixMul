% Scalar version of the AlphaEvolve algorithm for 4x4 complex-valued 
% matrix multiplication.
%
% This file contains the scalar version of the equations:
%   a_r = <u^(r), A>
% that compute the complex terms a0, ..., a47 after CSE algorithm.
%
% In the equations below, the real and imaginary parts of each 
% variable are indicated with '_r' and '_i', respectively 
% (e.g., a0_r, a0_i, a34_r).
% The equations of the Frobenius product have been separated
% leaving a total of 96 equations (48 for the real parts and 48 for the 
% imaginary parts).
%
% The input matrix A is a 4x4 matrix with complex values.
% It has been split into its real and imaginary parts, and each
% part has been vectorized. The terms are named Areal and Aimag.
%
% Hence, the terms below have the following meaning:
%   Areal(1)   = Re(A(1,1))
%   Aimag(1)   = Im(A(1,1))
%   Areal(2)   = Re(A(2,1))
%   Aimag(2)   = Im(A(2,1))
%   Areal(13)  = Re(A(1,3))
%   Aimag(14)  = Im(A(2,4))
